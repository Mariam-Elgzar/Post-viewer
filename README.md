# Post-viewer
## Project Description: 
The Blog Viewer App is a Flutter application designed to fetch and display 
blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. This app will follow the MVC 
(Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern for a clean and organized 
codebase, and it will use GetX for efficient and reactive state 
management.
